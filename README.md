# screen-id  
##*Version 1.0*
---
A website which tells you what device type you are currently using based on your screen size. 

It can identify 3 device types: desktop, tablet and mobile.  This is my first web project.  
It uses the `@media` attribute to fit the viewport into either one of three categories:  
```
@media screen and (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px)  
@media screen and (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 1280px)  
@media screen and (min-width: 1281px) and (max-width: 1920px)
```
